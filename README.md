# NGPINT: A Next-generation protein-protein interaction software


## Introduction

This software manual describes how to operate NGPINT to generate a list of potential interactors. NGPINT takes one configuration file in csv format. It generates all the intermediate and final files inside the output directory. NGPINT has been submitted for peer review, but the preprint can be accessed from <>. Please refer to the manuscript for more details about each module. The entire pipeline has been coded in Python 3. Included in the manual are explanations on how to install dependent softwares in the container environment generated by conda.
